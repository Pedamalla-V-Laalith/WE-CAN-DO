# WE-CAN-DO
This project enables users to manage their important day-to-day tasks or any other important works that the users might have.
<br>
Along with that this project also allows users to upload, organise and store any important notes that they might have which may come in handy for the users to reference them quickly.
<br>
Users can submit the details of their important tasks which may include time of the task, time at which the user wants to be intimated, and frequency of intimation.
<br>
Users can decide whether they want to notified about their upcoming todos. Based on their preference the website will start notifying them about a particular task from the time at which user wants to be intimated at a frequency which is also set by the users themselves.
<br>
This is acheived with the usage of Service worker API and Push notification API. Which also allows the users to recieve the notifications on their preffered devices.
<br>
If the users want to unsubscribe the notifications they can do so at any time.
<br>
This project also allows users to store any important bits of information that they might want to store.
